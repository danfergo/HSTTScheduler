# HSTTScheduler

The HSTTScheduler is (half developed) library that facilitates the implementation of scheduling algorithms in C++. Currently it supports the [XHSTT-2014](https://www.utwente.nl/ctit/hstt/archives/XHSTT-2014/) format and has implemented a genetic algorithm based solver.

For more information about the library and or the solver check out the attached presentation ([here](https://github.com/danfergo/HSTTScheduler/blob/master/(High)%20School%20Timetabling%20-%20MPE.pdf)) and or article ([here](https://github.com/danfergo/HSTTScheduler/blob/master/An_approach_to_the_High_School_TimetablingProblem_based_on_Genetic_Algorithms.pdf)).
